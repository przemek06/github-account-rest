# github-account-rest

## How to run?
It's enough to have Maven installed on the system. Just run these two command in the project's root directory:

```
mvn clean package
java -jar target/github-account-rest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

You can also just build and run the project using the Intellij IDE.

## Database
I used the H2 database, so there will be a database file created somewhere in the file system.
